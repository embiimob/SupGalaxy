# 🌌 SupGalaxy v1.0.4
**SupGalaxy** is an open-source, serverless voxel world—**Minecraft-style gameplay fused with satoshi-grade decentralization**. Worlds generate from simple keyword seeds and sync globally through **IPFS + P2FK** on Bitcoin testnet3. No accounts. No servers. No gatekeepers. Just your browser and an infinite procedural cosmos.

Built with ❤️ by **embii4u**, **kattacomi**, **Grok (xAI)**, **Jules**, **ChatGPT** and **github CoPilot**.

# ⚔️ Multiplayer: Drag-and-Drop WebRTC

### Host
1. Start a world.  
2. Receive an **offer** file from a client.  
3. Accept via Pending Connections or drag onto the minimap.  
4. Game creates an **answer** file.  
5. Send the answer back to the client.

### Client
1. Open 🌐 **Online Players** → enter host name → click join
2. Download **offer** file.  
3. Send to host.  
4. Receive **answer**.  
5. Drag it onto your minimap.

Connection established → avatars appear → PvP active.

# 🧩 Developer Guide

SupGalaxy is entirely browser-based—no bundlers, node modules, or build steps.

### Core Architecture
- **three.js** rendering  
- Infinite procedural chunks (16×64×16)  
- Background worker polling P2FK  
- WebRTC peer-to-peer networking  
- Simple JS modules

### Extend SupGalaxy

#### Add a Block
```js
BLOCKS[id] = {
  name: "StarBlock",
  color: "#hex",
  transparent: true
};
```

#### Add a Recipe
```js
RECIPES.push({
  id: "star",
  out: { id: 120, count: 1 },
  requires: { 4: 2 }
});
```

#### Add a Biome
```js
BIOMES.push({
  key: "nebula",
  palette: [16, 4],
  heightScale: 2.0,
  roughness: 0.7,
  featureDensity: 0.01
});
```

#### Multiplayer Hooks
- Position sync via `user_update`  
- Avatar rendering through `userPositions`  
- TURN server strongly recommended  

#### IPFS Block Versioning
SupGalaxy uses a **truncated unix date** system to ensure block updates from IPFS remain in correct chronological order:

- **BlockDate from Blockchain**: When chunks are published to the blockchain via IPFS, they receive a BlockDate from the transaction. This BlockDate is returned by GetPublicMessagesByAddress when loading chunks by keyword search.
- **Truncated Unix Date**: Seconds since 2025-09-21 00:00:00 UTC (custom epoch). This provides a compact integer for versioning.
- **Monotonic Ordering**: Block updates are only accepted if they have a strictly newer (larger) truncated unix date than any existing update.
- **Out-of-Order Protection**: If IPFS files arrive or are processed out of order, older updates are automatically skipped.

Helper functions:
```js
// Compute truncated date from a BlockDate timestamp (in milliseconds)
const truncated = computeIpfsTruncatedDate(blockTimestampMs);

// Check if an IPFS update should be applied (returns true if incoming > existing)
if (shouldApplyIpfsUpdate(existingTruncated, incomingTruncated)) {
  // Apply the update
}
```

Run tests in the browser console: `runIpfsVersioningTests()`

# 🌐 Local Decentralized Setup (Advanced)

Run your own **Sup!?** + **p2fk.io** stack for full independence.

### Requirements
- Windows  
- ~260 GB free (Bitcoin testnet3)  
- .NET 8.0+  
- Fast SSD  

### 1. Install & Sync Sup!?
- Extract `Supv0.7.6-beta` to `C:\SUP`  
- Launch `SUP.exe`  
- Enable **testnet**  
- Sync (1–2 days)  

### 2. Run Local p2fk.io API

Edit `Wrapper.cs`:

```csharp
public string TestCLIPath = @"C:\SUP\SUP.exe";
public string TestVersionByte = @"111";
public string TestRPCURL = @"http://127.0.0.1:18332";
public string TestRPCUser = "good-user";
public string TestRPCPassword = "better-password";
```

Start API → http://localhost:5000

### 3. Point SupGalaxy to Your API
Search/replace `https://p2fk.io` with your local endpoint.

### 4. Etch Saves
Export JSON from the game → publish using Sup!? → peers sync automatically.
